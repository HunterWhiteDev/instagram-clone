### Note: You need the the API keys for `src/firebaseKeys.ts`. Contact me at hunter.white1801@gmail.com to get them.

## Getting Started:

To get started, follow these steps:

1. run `npm install`.
2. `cd` into `functions` and run `npm install`
3. create a file at `src/firebaseKeys.ts` and use the keys I gave you.
4. Once all the dependancies are installed and the API keys have been entered in their appropriate place, running `npm start` should spin up the local development branch.
